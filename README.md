# MyPortfolio

# Title - Jack Smallwood, This is my second project taking part in the University of Birmingham Full Stack Web Development course. The assignment came with no starter code and was to develop a functioning landing page which had details of myself and also, responsive to different size screens.

# Description - To build the page from scratch. Sample previous work, include name & photo, functioning links to sections of the page, a unique title, functioning links to previous projects using placeholders and the page should be responsive to different size viewports & screen sizes.

# Motivation - The page should be accesible, resizeable and demonstrate use of semantic HTML where possible and effective CSS classes.

# Actions Taken - Created a semantic HTML structure, used CSS classes and selectors to add style classes to elements of my page to make it look more professional. Use of media screen to make it responsive to different viewports and screen sizes. Use of a elements and href to link external images and links. Also use of CSS flex.

# Problems Solved - The page is responsive, shows working links and loads with clean semantic HTML and condensed CSS style sheet.
